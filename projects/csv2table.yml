    - Created for the Census Bureau.
    - Our workflow required regularly loading CSV data from customers into an OracleDB table.
    - Regular solution was to use SQLLOADER, a cumbersome and unintuitive process.
    - csv2table was an easy-to-use tool that automated the process, making it much faster to complete.
