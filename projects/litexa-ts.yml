- title: litexa-ts
  details:
    - Fork of litexa toolchain refactored to use Typescript.
    - Litexa is a Alexa Labs project to allow developing Alexa skills in English-like language.
    - Original uses Coffeescript, which is old and difficult to maintain.
    - Not a trivial refactor; original version heavily abuses coffeescript and commonjs.

      \underline{Utilized}: Typescript, AWS, Alexa, Node.js, Literate programming
