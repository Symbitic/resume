projects:
  #- title: csv2table
  #  details:
  #    - Created for the Census Bureau.
  #    - Our workflow required regularly loading CSV data from customers into an OracleDB table.
  #    - Regular solution was to use SQLLOADER, a cumbersome and unintuitive process.
  #    - csv2table was an easy-to-use tool that automated the process, making it much faster to complete.
  #    - Source code unavailable; proprietary and property of the Census Bureau.
  #    - >
  #      \underline{Utilized}: Java, JDBC, SQL, OracleDB.
  - title: SqlTest
    details:
      - Complete suite of programs for automating acceptance testing of SQL queries.
      - Testing was a laborious and repetitive process done entirely manually, with little collaboration.
      - Encourages collaboration by allowing test data to be created by customers.
      - Available as a command-line tool and GUI.
      - >
        \underline{Utilized}: C++, Qt5, QML, CSV, SQL, SQLite.
  - title: litexa-ts
    details:
      - Fork of litexa toolchain refactored to use Typescript.
      - Litexa is a Alexa Labs project to allow developing Alexa skills in English-like language.
      - Original uses Coffeescript, which is old and increasingly difficult to maintain.
      - Not a trivial refactor; original version heavily abuses coffeescript and commonjs.
      - >
        \underline{Utilized}: Typescript, AWS, Alexa, Node.js, Literate programming.
  - title: standard-release
    details:
      - Tool for automating the entire software release process using a single program.
      - Installs git hooks to enforce a standardized format for commit messages.
      - Parses commit messages to determine new release version and CHANGELOG entry.
      - Writes the new version number, generates CHANGELOG, commits changes, creates a git tag, pushes all changes to upstream.
      - >
        \underline{Utilized}: C++, libgit2, cmark, YAML, CommonMark, SemVer, Conventional Commits.
