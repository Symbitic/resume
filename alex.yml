  #- title: csv2table
  #  details:
  #    - Created for the Census Bureau.
  #    - Our workflow required regularly loading CSV data from customers into an OracleDB table.
  #    - Regular solution was to use SQLLOADER, a cumbersome and unintuitive process.
  #    - csv2table was an easy-to-use tool that automated the process, making it much faster to complete.
  #    - Source code unavailable; proprietary and property of the Census Bureau.
